Hello there lads! This is a simple but powerful and useful open source project written in Python.
Description: This is a project for scanning a list of URLs or websites, and it will validate and determine the use of Cloudflare of every URL/website.

Be sure to create a file named: links.txt, and put in your URLs or websites. Each line will contain one website or URL.
Then you can simply run the program, put in a custom amount of threads to use, and it will get to work, and save the contents and details to a results file.

If you have any ideas on what to add to this, let me know, or use the program code in this repository to improve or change the code and functionality.
If you have any issues about the program code or anything relating to running/using it, you can contact me on the Discord link within my Github profile.

God bless you, and enjoy the code, and have fun! ðŸ˜‰
